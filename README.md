## Description

This project provides users a place to post their ideas and opinions related to coding technologies and approaches. Users are also able to comment on other user posts to provide feedback and contribute to the discourse around web development practices. The application uses nodeJS with express, sequelize, handlebars and custom CSS styling used in a modularly developed Model-View-Controller arrangement, all of which was built from scratch.

## Future Developments

While the buttons for editing and deleting your posts are present, you will notice they do not currently work. A main goal for future development of this project is to connect those buttons to the database using new PUT and DELETE routes.

## Credits

Development followed the logic and even some code snippets from previous exercises and assignments in the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp Full Stack program. In particularly, most of the user-routes, server files and configuration for database connection have been cribbed from other files. At various points web resources like MDN Web Docs and W3Schools were consulted for syntax reminders.
